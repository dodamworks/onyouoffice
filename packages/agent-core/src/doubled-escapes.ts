/**
 * Some models escape a line break twice in the arguments of a tool call (seen with
 * gemini-3.5-flash-lite): the decoded text then holds a backslash and an "n" where a
 * line break was meant, and the document would show `\n` as two characters.
 *
 * `undoDoubledEscapes` turns those escapes back into what they stand for, but only when
 * the whole text looks escaped twice:
 * - it holds no real line break (a model that sends one knows how to);
 * - it holds `\n` or `\r`;
 * - every backslash starts `\n`, `\r`, `\t` or `\"` (a backslash before anything else,
 *   or two in a row, means the text has real backslashes, as in `C:\Users\new`);
 * - it has no drive path such as `C:\new`.
 * Otherwise the text is returned as it came.
 *
 * A tab becomes a space: the HWP editor refuses control characters in the text it writes.
 *
 * Apply it only to plain text a tool writes into the document. Text a call looks for must
 * stay as written (a document may already show `\n`), and HTML, formulas and code use
 * backslashes of their own (`\nabla`, `\n` in a script).
